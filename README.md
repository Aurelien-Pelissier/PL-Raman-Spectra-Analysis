# μPL-Raman-Spectra-Analysis

Micro-Photoluminescence (μPL) and and Raman spectroscopy are powerful characterization technique because providing many informations on the materials, such as optical and electronic properties. They are widely used techniques because they are non-destructives and have spatial resolution around 100nm. This repository contains the source code to analyze raw measurements performed by Raman and μPL spectroscopy.
