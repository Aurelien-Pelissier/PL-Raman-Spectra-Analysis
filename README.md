# Raman-μPL-Spectra-Analysis
Raman and Micro-Photoluminescence (μPL) spectroscopy are powerful characterization technique providing many useful informations on the sample, they are non-destructives and have a spatial resolution around 100nm, which makes them widely used in nanoscience. This repository contains the source code to analyze raw measurements performed by Raman and μPL spectroscopy.

## Characterized samples

The samples used in the experiments are "nanobeam", it consist of a one dimensional photonic cristal for photons confinement and a quantum well for electrons confinement, which can be coupled to create a Quantum Electro Dynamic system. Our goal is to have a better understanding of the physical phenomenons involved in nanobeams by performing space and time dependent measurement.


### Micro-Photoluminescence

μPL measurements provide information about the optical and electronic properties of the material. Particularly, The observed gaussian on the spectrum refers to the light emission of the quantum well, and the 4 lorentzian indicates the different confinement modes of the photonic cristal.
