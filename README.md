# Raman-μPL-Spectra-Analysis

Raman and Micro-Photoluminescence (μPL) spectroscopy are powerful characterization technique providing many informations on the optical and electronic properties of the material. They are widely used techniques because they are non-destructives and have spatial resolution around 100nm. This repository contains the source code to analyze raw measurements performed by Raman and μPL spectroscopy.
