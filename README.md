# μPL-Raman-Spectra-Analysis

Micro-Photoluminescence (μPL) and and Raman spectroscopy are powerful characterization technique providing many informations on the optical and electronic properties of the material. They are widely used techniques because they are non-destructives and have spatial resolution around 100nm. This repository contains the source code to analyze raw measurements performed by Raman and μPL spectroscopy.
