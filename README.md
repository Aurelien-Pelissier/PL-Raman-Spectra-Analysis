# Raman-μPL-Spectra-Analysis
Raman and Micro-Photoluminescence (μPL) spectroscopy are powerful characterization technique providing many useful informations on the sample, they are non-destructives and have spatial resolution around 100nm, which makes them widely used in nanoscience. This repository contains the source code to analyze raw measurements performed by Raman and μPL spectroscopy.

## Characterized sample
The sample used for our experiment involve two confinement:
- light confinement with a one dimensional photonic cristal
- electron confinement with a quantum well
Ramana and photoluminescence will provide us informations about the nanobeam.


### Micro-Photoluminescence

μPL measurements provide information about the optical and electronic properties of the material. Particularly, The observed gaussian on the spectrum refers to the light emission of the quantum well, and the 4 lorentzian indicates the different confinement modes of the photonic cristal.
