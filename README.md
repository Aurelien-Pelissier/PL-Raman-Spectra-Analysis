# Raman-μPL-Spectra-Analysis

Raman and Micro-Photoluminescence (μPL) spectroscopy are powerful characterization technique providing many informations on the optical and electronic properties of the material. They are widely used techniques because they are non-destructives and have spatial resolution around 100nm. This repository contains the source code to analyze raw measurements performed by Raman and μPL spectroscopy.

## Characterized sample
The sample used for our experiment involve two confinement:
- light confinement with a one dimensional photonic cristal
- electron confinement with a quantum well
Ramana and photoluminescence will provide us informations about the nanobeam.

The microPL spectrum provide information about the Quantum well (gaussian) and the photonic crystal (lorentzian)
