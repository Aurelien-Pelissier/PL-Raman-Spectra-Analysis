# Raman-μPL-Spectra-Analysis
Raman and Micro-Photoluminescence (μPL) spectroscopy are powerful characterization technique providing many useful informations on the sample, they are non-destructives and have a spatial resolution around 100nm, which makes them widely used in nanoscience. This repository contains the source code to analyze raw measurements performed by Raman and μPL spectroscopy.

## Characterized samples

The samples used in our experiments are "nanobeam", it consist of a one dimensional photonic cristal for photons confinement and a quantum well for electrons confinement, both particles can be coupled to create a Quantum Electro Dynamic system, and our goal is to have a better understanding of the physical phenomenons involved in nanobeams by performing space and time dependent measurement.


### Micro-Photoluminescence

μPL measurements provide information about the optical and electronic properties of the material. Particularly, in nanobeam μPL, the background light is from the Quatum well emission and can be fitted with a Gaussian, while the 4 observed peaks refers to the different confinement mode of the photonic cristal and are fitted with a Lorentzian. By anylizing both the position and the quality factor of these curve, we can extract informations about the quality and the temperature of the nanobeam.

Three different modes are visibles on the Raman spectra, one corrsepond to silicon and the other two are GaN
spectrum analysis with lorentzian fit. By anylizing both the position and the quality factor of these curve, we can extract informations about the strain state of the nanobeam.
